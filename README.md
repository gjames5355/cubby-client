## Purpose

I have downloaded and used countless shopping list, pantry organizer, fridge helper, and related apps but could never find one that could get the job done. They either were plagued by unintuitive UI/UX experience, or even worse, they were bloated with tons of excess features that over-complicate the already stressful task of managing the items in your house.

I just wanted something simple and elegant that showed me how much of something is left and when it was going to expire, _at a glance_.

The core philosophy that I stuck to when designing the user-facing view of Cubby was to show only as much as needed, and nothing more.
